fronttitle: "Planning Open Cities is a place to collect and share knowledge to help communities build open data policies."
frontintro: "This guide represents a first aggregation of the methods used by a range of institutions who have implemented open data programs around building more resilient societies. It is not the last word on how to design these projects, but rather should be seen as an initial scaffolding for building the next version of this guide. We encourage readers to contribute their own insights and institutions to join into a growing partnership."
